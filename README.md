# python Financial Data Analysis PKUJohnson
notebooks by learning 'python金融数据分析' in videos from internet.<br>
## some complaints
Breifly get througth these lectures but find out that the lecturer was basically promoted his own python-lib througthout the lectures. <br>
It make me a little uncomfortable because we already had **'Tushare'** and it is powerful and handy.

## some advises
So if your want to look at the videos or look through my notebooks, pick lecture 02/03/04/06 are enough.<br>
BTW, you have to read some chinese...
